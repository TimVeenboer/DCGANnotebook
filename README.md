## Deep Convolutional Generative Adverserial Network

This repository is largely based on the article from Ian Goodfellow et. al. Generative Adversarial Networks emulate a 'two-player adversarial game', where a generative model tries to trick a discriminative model. This discriminative model in turn tries to recognize whether an image has been produced by the generative model or whether it's a real image. 

Some results produced by the model in this repository:
